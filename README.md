# YosshChallenge - Expenses App

This is an expense app. It was made using React Native. It will allow you to save and view your expenses. This solution focuses on the front-end.

I wanted the app to be really simple. It needed to have all the expenses ready to view as soon as the app opens. It also needed a clear 'Add Expense' button. I decided to have the app use big headers and fonts for the sake of simplicity for the user. Each page has 3 main components: a header, body, and a large bottom button.

I was not able to finish the app. If I had more time, I would have added these things:
- Saving / Loading expenses
- Sorting expenses by date
- A login / signup page
- Better looking expense display items
- Real data
- Add expense validation (make sure all the fields have been filled out)
